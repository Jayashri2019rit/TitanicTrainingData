An Machine Learning for Disaster management prediction

Problem Statement:

Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not. The metric for scoring is the accuracy of prediction.

Project Description:

We need to get data. We'll use a sample data set for that .The raw data is completely infused in the workspace. The entries includes country, region and zone. Preprocessing is done before the analyzing part .But it can be helpful for either governments or high-risk installations.

I have developed using Azure Machine Learning Classic.
